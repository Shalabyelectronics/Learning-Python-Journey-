# Learning Python Journey 

Hi Everyone, this is my journey with learning How to program with python by taking this course

[100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023 - Projects Repository](https://www.udemy.com/share/103J8C3@8vF2huHnPspsSsg_l6VXD-iqxMR_Ug802BMSxnn6k3bZDuE1vOlKTp6DtG3TlHrp/)

I did all projects related of this course and I will share it in the Readme where I linked projects repository  for each one.

For the first 32 days I used [Replit](https://replit.com/) as I was not able to use Git version control or GitHub yet, so I will share my Replit profile [here](https://replit.com/@MohamedShalaby2).

**I will split projects as which domain is related to as below:** 

- [Command Line Interface projects.](#one)
- [Graphical User Interface Projects.](#two)
- [Web Development Projects.](#three)
- [Web Scraping Projects.](#five)
- [Web Testing and Automation Projects.](#six)
